## Front-End Dev Memory Game Project

#### Summary:
Create a memory matching game with 8 pairs of cards.  The game must track and display move count and playtime. The game window must also include a game reset button. This resets the board, timer and move count.

At the end of the game the user should see a modal with playtime, rating and the option to play again.
